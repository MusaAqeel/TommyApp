- **QR code Scanner- Leads to databases on potential clubs and club information**
        - Need to get Clubs to place QR codes on posters when advertisements 

### Other Ideas:
- Discover section where people can discover clubs and initiatives our school is participating in and how we can join them as well
- Maybe include a quiz where we can allow them to try and find the clubs that suit them the best
- Reference potential answers to clubs(set key words for clubs and make the system search for them)
